# Sandwiches For Aliens
A deadpan addition to my tech writing portfolio based on the classic PB&J interview question, intended to show instructional skills.

## Defining the sandwich

A sandwich is type of food consisting of an edible layer, or multiple layers, of foodstuffs placed between two (2) edible pieces of bread.

Bread is a food made from flour, water, and a leavening agent like yeast mixed together and baked.

## Requirements for construction

- A clean and stable table, or any surface, with enough flat surface area to contain the forthcoming materials. If there is not enough space for everything then items must be swapped on and off the surface as they become needed. The greater and more accessible the surface area, the easier construction will be.
- A loaf of bread. The loaf must be large enough to derive two (2) slices, each with a surface area sufficient to cover the majority of the internal layers.
    - Pre-sliced bread is also acceptable.
- A knife or other slicing instrument capable of splitting the bread and other foodstuffs into even slices. If the instrument is too blunt the slices will tear.
- Foodstuffs for the internal layers. These layers can be sliced similarly to the bread. They can also be in the form of thinly spread liquid, or even an abundance of small items sprinkled atop or between the internal layers. Any foodstuffs used must be edible and should be layered to the satisfaction of the sandwich eater.
    - If any foodstuffs require, ensure a sufficiently sharp slicing instrument is available.
    - If any foodstuffs require heat or refrigeration, accomodations must be made to ensure all layers remain edible up to and through the moment of consumption. The exact requirements will vary with the foodstuffs chosen.
- A cutting board for slicing the foodstuffs before transfering the foodstuffs onto the sandwich.
- A plate intended to ferry the sandwich to the sandwich eater and capture fallen foodstuffs.
- Cleaning agents to sanitise any surfaces involved and the hands of both the sandwich preparer and the sandwich eater.
    - WARNING: Ensure any dangerous or inedible chemical agents do not contaminate any part of the sandwich.
- Multiple napkins.
- If the sandwich is not being prepared for the sandwich preparer, ensure an understanding of the sandwich eaters' expectations is reached before sandwich construction begins.

## Construction of the sandwich

1) Gather the requirements, placing the ferrying plate and the cutting board comfortably within reach atop the stable surface.
2) Place the bread on the cutting board and ready the slicing instrument. Take every precaution to use the slicing instrument safely.
3) Utilize the slicing instrument to slice the bread, producing two (2) slices of matching surface area.
    - The length and width of each slice will vary with the type of bread. The thickness of each slice will also vary with the type of bread, but in general each slice should be thick enough to support the internal foodstuffs and not much thicker. Any excess thickness translates to an excess of bread in each bite, though this effect may be desirable to some.
    - Traditionally, the two short ends of a loaf of bread are not used for sandwich construction.
4) Place the two slices on the ferrying plate then place the remainder of the non-sliced bread aside, preferably in any container originally provided to enclose the bread.
5) Place one slice of bread flat on the center of the ferrying plate, this is the bottom of the sandwich. Place the other slice, the top of the sandwich, on the rim of the ferrying plate for later use.
6) Ready the foodstuffs near the cutting board in whatever containers their attributes require.
7) Prepare and layer the foodstuffs atop the bottom of the sandwich. Be sure to utilize as much of the surface of the bottom of the sandwich as possible, to prevent uneven consumption of the internal layers.
    - If a foodstuff requires slicing, place it on the cutting board and slice to the dimensions desired by the sandwich eater with the appropriate slicing instrument.
    - Ensure proper sanitization of instruments and surfaces between foodstuffs.
8) Place the other slice of bread, the top of the sandwich, atop the layered foodstuffs so that the slices of bread are parallel to each other with the foodstuffs between them.
9) Return the unused foodstuffs to their respective containers.
10) Deliver the ferrying plate with the completed sandwich on top to the sandwich eater.
    - If the sandwich is for you, enjoy the meal!
11) Return the containers of foodstuffs and bread to their appropriate places in storage.
12) Clean any slicing instruments and surfaces utilized during the sandwich construction.
13) Return the slicing instruments, cutting board, and ferrying plate to the appropriate storage once the sandwich eater has finished their meal.

That's it! You now know how to construct a sandwich of any variety.
