# Sandwiches For Aliens
A deadpan addition to my tech writing portfolio based on the classic PB&J question, intended to show instructional skills.

## Defining the sandwich

This is a contentious point of debate among humans but for our purposes a sandwich will be defined as follows: An edible layer, or multiple layers, of foodstuffs placed between two edible pieces of bread, atop one and beneath the other. Edible is defined with respect to the consuming organism's digestive system. Do not consume foodstuffs incompatible with your physiology.

Instructions to be provided will assume a dexterity of appendages and fine motor skills comprable to that of humans. Workarounds for non-human physiologies will provided at the conclusion of this guide.

## Requirements for construction

- A clean, physical, stable surface with enough flat surface area to contain forthcoming materials. If there is not enough space for everything, items will have to be swapped on and off the surface. The greater and more accessible the surface area, the easier construction will be.
- Bread. The form must be voluminous enough to derive two (2) slices with a matching surface area sufficient to occlude approximately 90% of the internal layers upon completion of construction.
- A slicing instrument capable of splitting the bread into smooth, even slices. If the instrument is too blunt the bread will tear, and this is not desirable for the ideal sandwich construction.
- Foodstuffs for the internal layers. These can be thinly sliced similarly to the bread, or they can be liquid, or even an abundance of unobtrusive items sprinkled atop or between other internal layers. It all must be edible, and should be layered to the satisfaction of the consuming organism. The only constraint is the amount of risk the consuming organism is willing to take on with respect to the stability of construction.
    - If any foodstuffs require slicing of their own, ensure a sufficiently sharp slicing instrument is available.
    - If any foodstuffs require heat or refrigeration, accomodations must be made to ensure all layers remain edible up to and through the moments of consumption. This will vary with the foodstuffs chosen.
- A surface for cutting foodstuffs before transfer to the sandwich.
- A plate, or any mobile, easily manipulated surface intended to ferry the sandwich to its destination and capture fallen foodstuffs.
- Cleaning agents to sanitise any surfaces involved and the manipulating appendages of the sandwich preparer and the consuming organism.
    - WARNING: Ensure any dangerous or inedible chemical agents stay isolated from the constituents of the sandwich, so as to avoid ingestion of said chemical agents.
- Multiple napkins, or any clean fabrics capable of wiping fallen foodstuffs off surfaces or the consuming organism. These napkins should be disposed of or washed after use, depending on the quality of the fabrics.
    - WARNING: If chemical agents are necessary to sanitize the area affected by fallen foodstuffs it must be ensured that they do not contaminate the sandwich or the manipulating appendages of the consuming organism during the process of consumption.
- If the sandwich is not being prepared for the sandwich preparer, ensure an understanding of the consuming organisms' expectations is reached before construction begins.

## Construction of the sandwich

0) Gather the requirements, placing the ferrying surface and the cutting surface near each other and within reach of you, the sandwich preparer, atop the stable surface.
1) Place the bread on the cutting surface, align the cutting surface in front of you, and ready the slicing instrument.
2) Utilize the slicing instrument to slice the bread, producing two (2) slices of matching surface area. The length and width of each slice will vary with the type of bread. The thickness of each slice will also vary with the type of bread, but in general each slice should be thick enough to support the internal foodstuffs and not much thicker. Any excess thickness translates to an excess of bread throughout the process of consumption, though this effect may be desirable for some consuming organisms.
3) Place the two slices on the ferrying surface, then place the remainder of the non-sliced bread aside, preferably in any container originally provided to enclose the bread.
4) Place one slice of bread flat on the center of the ferrying surface, this is the bottom of the sandwich. Place the other slice, the top of the sandwich, on the rim of the ferrying surface for later use.
5) Ready the foodstuffs near the cutting surface in whatever containers their attributes require.
5) Layer the foodstuffs atop the bottom of the sandwich as deemed appropriate. Be sure to utilize as much of the surface of the bottom of the sandwich as possible, to prevent uneven consumption of the internal layers. Minor discontinuities are acceptable and sometimes desired by the consuming organism.
    - If a foodstuff requires slicing, place it on the cutting surface and slice to the dimensions desired by the consuming organism with the appropriate slicing instrument. - Ensure proper sanitization between foodstuffs, if it is required.
6) Place the other slice of bread, the top of the sandwich, atop the layered foodstuffs so that the slices of bread are parallel, or near parallel, with the foodstuffs between them.
7) Return the unused foodstuffs to their respective containers.
8) Deliver the ferrying surface, atop which sits the sandwich, to the consuming organism.
9) Return the containers of foodstuffs and bread to their appropriate places in storage.
10) Clean any slicing instruments and surfaces utilized during the sandwich construction.
11) Return the slicing instruments, cutting surface, and ferrying surface—once the consuming organism has finished the sandwich—to the appropriate storage.
    - If the consuming organism is you, enjoy the meal!

## Workarounds

### I do not possess the dexterity or strength or other innate means to slice the bread.

Humans possess fine motor skills with dextrous apendages and are able to apply their slicing instrument manually. In the absense of manual manipulation an automated guillotine like device may be necessary to adequately slice the bread and foodstuffs.

### The consuming organism does not possess the ability to masticate.

In the absence of hard teeth and a powerful jaw, or a friendly and sanitary organism willing to provide such a service, an external mastication device will have to be applied. A variety of blender could be applied to the sandwich, or, depending on the physiology of the consuming organism, simple trauma with a blunt and pointed object such as a meat tenderizor may provide a sufficient replacement.

## The consuming organism does not possess the digestive system to convert sandwich to nutrients.

This is approaching the limits of sandwich consumption, but the sandwich may be processed through an external digestive system until it enters a form suitable for nutrient derivation.

## The consuming organism can not interact with the matter of the sandwich.

Unfortunately, this falls outside the scope of this guide. The physiology of the writer of this guide renders them unable to meaningfully speculate on the contents of a nonmaterial sandwich.
